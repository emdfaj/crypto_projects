# Crypto Projects

## Overview

This repository contains various projects related to cryptocurrency, utilizing AI and Machine Learning techniques. The focus is on applying data science to enhance understanding and insights in the crypto space. The first project showcases a sentiment analysis of crypto news using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).


## Project 1: Crypto News Sentiment Analysis

### Overview

In this project, I implemented a sentiment analysis model to evaluate the sentiment of news articles related to cryptocurrencies. Using BERT, a powerful transformer-based model, the analysis aims to predict whether the sentiment expressed in the articles is positive, negative, or neutral.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of crypto-related news articles, collected from various online sources. Each article is labeled with sentiment scores to train and evaluate the model.

### Results

The project includes performance metrics of the BERT model, visualizations of the sentiment distribution, and insights into how news sentiment correlates with cryptocurrency price movements.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis using BERT for accurate text classification.
- Detailed performance evaluation of the model.
- Visualization of sentiment trends over time.
- Insights into the relationship between news sentiment and cryptocurrency prices.

## Installation

To set up this project, ensure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install transformers pandas matplotlib seaborn
